# Task: CLI Unit Tests

TBD how we will do this. Below is a general task list associated with this.


1. [ ] Test `add_person` command with valid and invalid input.

2. [ ] Test `remove_person` command with existing and non-existing user names.

3. [ ] Test `add_relationship` command with valid and invalid parameters.

4. [ ] Test `remove_relationship` command with existing and non-existing relationships.

    - Considerations:
        - Mock the service layer to isolate the UI layer during testing.
        - Cover edge cases and ensure user inputs are handled gracefully.
